# Itinerate Workers and the Exodus of Wealth

**Background.** During exploratory analysis for ["Building Equity in the Construction Trades: A Racial Equity Impact Statement"](https://issuu.com/lscny/docs/reisfinal_3-8-19_compressed) (Croom, et al. 2019), a report authored in collaboration between Legal Services of Central New York (LSCNY), Urban Jobs Task Force (UJTF), and independent analyst Jamison Crawford, a significant amount of gross income was earned in public construction projects by itinerate workers living outside Onondaga County, where said projects took place. However, only racial disparities in hourage, working periods, and gross income were reported.

**Objectives.** This analysis is of two specific projects and, in particular, gross income and location: 

* [Hancock International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_Hancock_International_Airport) renovations
* Construction of [Lakeview Amphitheater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview_Amphitheater)

Records failing to disclose gross income, `gross`, and ZIP code, `zip`, are excluded. Variables on race or ethnicity, `race`, and gender, `sex`, have been addressed in the racial equity impact statement and are excluded from analysis.
